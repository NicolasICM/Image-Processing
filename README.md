In this work I explain the method SIRT for use in the tomography axial computerized with fan beam on dilution tunnel, focused to measurement particulate matter on combustion systems. 
The measurement will be using an arrangement of photodiodes in the visible spectrum, that detect the emission from fan beam of led lights of high luminosity.

This work is divided in four path:
1. Measurement intensity of light from Photodiodes.
2. Processing the transmittance from each Photodiode.
3. Send value to CPU for Processing the image reconstruction.
4. Plot the Sinogram in real time of the distribution particulate matter in the time t=1.

##This project is under development, so I´m sorry for the mistakes.
